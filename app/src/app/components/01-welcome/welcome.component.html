        <p>Dr.Bart Knijnenburg of Clemson University invites you to take part in a research study
            on novel recommender systems. You will be asked to rate movies and will then be shown recommendations
            based on your choices. Your participation in this study will be highly valued.</p>
        <p>The study should take from <b>10 - 15 minutes</b> to complete. There are four parts:</p>
        <ol id="steps">
            <li>Begin Study</li>
            <li>Read Instructions</li>
            <li>Browse Recommendations</li>
            <li>Complete Survey</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the survey is completed, you will be given a code to facilitate payment of $2.00. You will need
